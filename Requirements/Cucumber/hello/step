Feature: greeter says hello
  
  In order to start learning RSpec and Cucumber
  As a reader of The RSpec Book
  I want a greeter to say Hello

  Scenario: greeter says hello         # features\greeter_says_hello.feature:7
    Given a greeter                    # features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:7
    When I send it the greet message   # features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:11
    Then I should see "Hello Cucumber" # features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:15
      expected: "Hello Cucumber"
           got: "Hello Cucumber!" (using ==) (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:16:in `/^I should see "([^"]*)"$/'
